# RMIT Online Courses Page

Here is a page I really like, which I have tried to clone. It's not exactly the same but it's pretty close. It filters the courses on offer at the RMIT Univeristy with the main filter and also has a secondary filter which fine tunes the search.

It was quite a challenge to get the main filter and secondary filter to work together.You will notice that when the main filter buttons are clicked the second time the 'ALL' button becomes active. I have paid attention to all the details.

I have also used the custom properties (CSS Variables) for the first time, to be able to control the color codes on the page.

Buttons have ripple effects similar to material-design but made with Vanilla Javascript.

Here is the github pages link. https://shmula1308.github.io/RMIT-UNI-Courses-Page-Clone/ Unfortunately the images are breaking and course cards are not animating on github pages. Please download the project instead.
